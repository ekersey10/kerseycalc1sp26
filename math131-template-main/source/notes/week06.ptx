<title>Week 6 (9/29 - 10/3)</title>

<p>
  This week we discuss the product and quotient rules (section 2.3) and then apply them to additional trig functions (section 2.4).

  <title>Monday 9/29</title>
  
  <p>
    We know how to take derivatives of a bunch of basic functions, as well as how to take derivatives of functions that are the sum or difference of those functions.  The <term>sum rule</term> says that the derivative of a sum is just the sum of the derivatives.  That is, if <m>f(x)</m> is the sum of two functions, we can find <m>f'(x)</m> by taking the derivatives of each of the two functions and adding the results.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, this is not true for products.  On the one hand, we can quickly see that this fails if we take the derivative of <m>f(x) = x^3\cdot x^7</m>.  On one hand, we could simplify this function as <m>f(x) = x^{10}</m>, so <m>f'(x) = 10x^{9}</m>.  However, if we took the derivative of the two parts separately, we would have <m>3x^2</m> and <m>7x^6</m>.  Multiplying those would give <m>21x^8</m> which is definitely not the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another reason to be skeptical: suppose a magic rectangle has sides <m>l</m> and <m>w</m>, both of which are increasing with time.  The <em>area</em> of the rectangle is then also a function of time.  That is, <m>A(t) = l(t)\cdot w(t)</m>.  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let's say that <m>l(5) = 20</m> and <m>w(5) = 30</m>.  Then <m>A(5) = 600</m>.  How much new area do you get if <m>l(t)</m> increases by <m>3</m> and <m>w(t)</m> increases by <m>4</m> in the next day?  Does the area just increase by <m>12</m>?   
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          No, since <m>l(6)</m> growing to 23  doesn't just add 3 feet: we get area of <m>3 \cdot 30 = 90</m> more feet!  And when the width increases by 4 feet, that adds <m>4 \cdot 20 = 80</m> more feet.    
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Draw the picture.  Every increase in one dimension must be multiplied by the current size of the other dimension.  
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In other words, the increase is <m>\Delta l \cdot w + \Delta w \cdot l</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This gives us the <term>product rule</term>:  if <m>P(x) = f(x)\cdot g(x)</m>, then <m>P'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x) g'(x)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do a few examples with functions we know.  Start with <m>x^3x^7</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Quotients have a similar rule: the <term>quotient</term> rule says that if <m>Q(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> then <me>
      Q'(x) = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}
    </me>.
    We can <q>prove</q> this from the product rule by noting that <m>f(x) = Q(x)g(x)</m>.  Apply the product rule and then solve for <m>Q'(x)</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Try some examples.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that we can use both rules in the same function.  A function that is the ratio of a product and another function, for example.

  <title>Tuesday 9/30</title>
  
  <p>
    Today we practiced additional examples of the product rule and the quotient rule, including an example where the product rule is required in the numerator of a quotient.

  <title>Wednesday 10/1</title>
  
  <p>
    Our goal today is to discover derivative rules for the rest of the main trigonometric functions: <m>\tan(x)</m>, <m>\cot(x)</m>, <m>\sec(x)</m>, and <m>csc(x)</m>.  
  </p>

  <p>
    First, remember the <term>Fundamental Trigonometric Identity</term>: <me>
      \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1
    </me>.
    This is just a version of the Pythagorean Theorem on the unit circle.  We will use this to simplify the derivatives for the other trig functions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Look at <m>\tan(x)</m>.  In right triangles, <m>\tan(\theta)</m> is the ratio of the leg opposite the angle to the leg adjacent to it.  But look at the unit circle, and remember that <m>y = \sin(\theta)</m> and <m>x = \cos(\theta)</m>, we have <m>\tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}</m>.
    So to find the derivative of <m>\tan(x)</m> we should apply the quotient rule to that ratio.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, we can do this for all the other functions.  Go through them.

  <title>Friday 10/3</title>
  
  <p>
    Today we will do a little review about what we know how to do with derivatives already and explore the one way we don't yet know to take derivatives of combined functions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Start with four warmup derivatives.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the very few minutes left after that, we discussed what composition of functions looks like.  This will help us understand the chain rule next week.
