  <title>Week 2 (1/20 - 1/23)</title>

  <p>
    This week we cover sections 1.3 and some of 1.4 of the textbook.
    This introduces the derivative at a point, and the derivative function.
  </p>

  <title>Tuesday, 1/20</title>

  <p>
    Today we will start by discussing any questions about the practice problems due tonight.
    Then some discussion section 1.3 on the derivative at a point.
    Finally, we will do the first Learning Target Quiz.
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Look at question 2 from last Friday's activity.
          We want to evaluate that limit.
          Notice that it is a very particular type of limit.
          It is a limit of an average velocity between two points.
          What are they?
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The points are <m>(a, f(a))</m> and <m>(a+h, f(a+h))</m>, where <m>f(x) = x^2 + 5x</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Look at the preview activity for 1.3.
          Go over this carefully.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          We will want to evaluate these sorts of limits a bunch.
          But what does <m>\d\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}</m> look like for different functions?  Try this out with a bunch of different examples.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The limit of this <term>difference quotient</term> is called the <term>derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>a</m></term>, and written <m>f'(a)</m>.
          Here we are thinking of <m>a</m> as a specific number.
          So examples would be <m>f'(2)</m> or <m>f'(0)</m>.

  <p>
    Learning target quizzes discussion.
    Reminder: you try this again so that you can demonstrate mastery.
    Your next opportunity is next Tuesday.
    Let's talk a little bit about instantaneous velocity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's continue investigating the <term>derivative of a function at a point</term>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Look at the interactive applet the textbook links to.
          Compare this to the definition of the derivative we discussed in class and the idea of the instantaneous velocity.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          We can always approximate a derivative at a point by approximating the limit of the average rate of change.
          In other words, approximating the <term>difference quotient</term> at that point.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Sometimes, we can find the derivative <em>exactly</em> by computing that limit exactly.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Let's think of this as two distinct steps: First, we want to find an expression whose limit is the derivative at a point.
          Second, we want to evaluate that limit.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Here are some examples.
          For each function below, write a limit that represents the derivative at the given point.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x+1}</m>.
          Find an expression for <m>f'(3)</m>, the derivative at <m>a = 3</m>.
          Then repeat for <m>f'(8)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x) = x^2 + 5x</m>.
          Find an expression for <m>f'(2)</m>, the derivative at <m>a = 2</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 1</m>.
          Find an expression for <m>f'(1)</m>, the derivative at <m>a = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x) = \sin(x) + \cos(x)</m>.
          Find an expression for <m>f'(0)</m>, the derivative at <m>a = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    Pay attention to how the substitution of the function and the difference quotient interact.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, evaluate some of the limits we found.
    Note that the last one...
    no clue what to do there.

  <title> Friday, 1/23 </title>
    <p>
      Today we start looking at section 1.4, thinking about the derivative as a function.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Start with an example.  Let <m>f(x) = x^2 + 1</m>.  Find <m>f'(3)</m>.  Then, what is <m>f'(4)</m>? Can we also find <m>f'(42)</m>?  
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In fact, we can find <m>f'(a)</m> for any number <m>a</m>.  One way to think of this is that we are creating a rule to help us find a lot of different derivatives.  We are giving a recipe.  No matter what <m>a</m> is, we can always find <m>f'(a)</m> by simply...
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            But really we are doing more.  At any point in the domain of <m>f</m>, we can find a derivative.  That derivative changes when <m>a</m> changes.  So there is actually a <em>function</em> of derivatives.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We can describe a function in multiple ways.  A formula.  A table.  A graph.  
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Look at a graph of a function.  At any input, we can ask: what is the slope of the line tangent to the graph?  We can then collect these answers in a table.  That is describing the derivative function!  We can also graph these values to get a graph of <m>f'(x)</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let's repeat this with a few functions.  
            
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  a piecewise linear function.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A parabola.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>y=x^3</m>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <m>f(x) = e^x</m>
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>

          </p>
