<title>Week 5 (9/22 - 9/26)</title>
<p>
  This week we finish section 2.1 and 2.2.  This will give us lots of functions that we can take the derivative of.
</p>

  <title>Monday 9/22</title>
  <p>
    Last time we learned how to take derivatives of power functions, like <m>f(x) = x^4</m>, but also <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} = x^{-2}</m> and <m>f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} = x^{-1/3}</m>.  The rule is that for any constant <m>n</m>, if <me>
      f(x) = x^n
    </me>
    then <me>
      f'(x) = nx^{n-1}
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also looked at how to combine functions: <m>f(x) = g_1(x) +g_2(x)</m> has derivative <m>f'(x) = g_1'(x) + g_2'(x)</m>.  And if <m>f(x)</m> is a constant multiple of another function, say <m>f(x) = 5g(x)</m>, then <m>f'(x) = 5g'(x)</m>.  For example, <m>f(x) = 7x^3</m> will have derivative <m>f'(x) = 7\cdot(3x^2) = 21x^2</m>.
  </p>
  

  <p>
    Today, let's practice these derivatives.  Write down a bunch of functions that we can take derivatives of and do it.  Include some that need to be simplified first.
  </p>

  <p>
    What if we have <m>f(x) = 2^x</m>?  Is the derivative <m>f'(x) = x2^{x-1}</m>?  No!  We can verify this by graphing both.  So actually we do want to graph these exponential functions and numerically compute the derivatives.  It turns out that for any constant <m>a</m>, the function <m>f(x) = a^x</m> has derivative <m>f'(x) = a^x \ln(a)</m>. 
  </p>

  <p>
    In other words, the derivative if an exponential function is proportional to itself, with constant of proportionality <m>\ln(a)</m> where <m>a</m> is the base.  Note that since <m>\ln(e) = 1</m>, this says that <m>\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x</m>.

  <p>
    The goal of section 2.2 is to develop rules for the derivatives of <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m>.  We could think of these rules as arbitrary, but to help us remember and make sense of them, it will be useful to briefly review some trigonometry.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Perhaps you learned trigonometry as a method for finding the lengths of legs of right triangles.  What does <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m> tell you there?
  </p>

  <p>
    We want to extend this meaning to a larger domain of angles, not just between 0 and 90 degrees.
  </p>
        <p>
          Now we want the triangle with base on the <m>x</m>-axis and angle at the origin to still obey the usual relationships for <m>\sin(\theta)</m> and <m>\cos(\theta)</m>.  So this means that <m>\sin(\theta)</m> will be the <m>y</m>-value of the circle, and <m>\cos(\theta)</m> is the <m>x</m>-value.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now continuing this, it makes sense to ask for <m>\sin(3\pi/4)</m>.  We just need to know what the <m>y</m> value is on the circle at that point.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice that we are using a circle with radius 1 here, so while <m>\sin(\theta) = y/r</m>, we really get <m>y</m>.

  <title>Wednesday 9/24</title>
  
  <p>
    Let's pick up where we left off with our review of basic trigonometry.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <p>
          First we want to switch to using radians.  What do those means?  1 radian is the angle that gives you an arc of the circle of length equal to the radius of the circle.  
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The key thing though is that the circumference of a circle is <m>\2\pi r</m>, so the full angle of a circle gives an arc length of <m>2\pi</m> times the radius.  Thus a full circle (<m>360^\circ</m>) is <m>2\pi</m> radians.  
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          From this, we can divide a circle into smaller chunks.  Half a circle is <m>\pi</m> radians, etc.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
    <p>
    Now we can think of both <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m> as being functions of <m>x</m>.  But here <m>x</m> is the angle and <m>y = f(x)</m> is the value of the function (which is an <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> value on the unit circle).  Let's graph those functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now what about the rate of change of those functions?  Think about what increasing from 0 to 1 radian does to the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values on the unit circle!   
  </p>
  <p>
    We can also look at this graphically, by considering slopes of the sine and cosine functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The point is, <m>\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x) = \cos(x)</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx}\cos(x) = -\sin(x)</m>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let's see how to combine all the rules we have so far.  Work through the activity.
