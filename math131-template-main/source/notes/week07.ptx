    This week we will learn the chain rule (section 2.5) and then apply it to find rules for a few more functions (section 2.6).

    Today we learned the chain rule and went through many examples.  See section 2.5 of the textbook for such exampels.

  <p>
    Let's think a bit about why the chain rule makes sense.  Remember that the chain rule describes how to take the derivative of a composition of functions: <m>f(g(x))</m>.  For this to make sense, it must be that the output of <m>g(x)</m> is a reasonable input to <m>f(x)</m>.  What functions would this make sense for?
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Suppose you own a company that makes artisanal soap.  The number of bars of soap you can make is a function of the amount of money you spend on supplies, say <m>g(x) = 3x - 20</m>.  The amount of money you earn from your soap business is a function of the number of bars of soap you make (and sell): <m>f(x) = 7x</m>.  What happens to your income if you increase your investment by a dollar when you are already spending $100? 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Another application: the daily water consumption in Greeley is a function of the population: <m>w(p) = 30p + 10,000</m>.  The population of Greeley is a function of time: <m>P(t) = 100,000 \cdot 1.2^t</m>.  At what rate is the water consumption increasing as a function of time?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    We can also use the limit definition of the derivative to understand the chain rule.  
    <md>
      <mrow>
        \frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(g(x+h)) - f(g(x))}{h}
      </mrow>
      <mrow> \amp = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(g(x+h)) - f(g(x))}{g(x+h)-g(x)}\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}</mrow>
    </md>    
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, let's do some more examples.  First a straight forward example, such as <m>f(x) = (\sin(x) + x^2)^8</m>.  Then a few where you need to use the chain rule together with other rules, like the product rule, the quotient rule, or the chain rule itself.

  <title>Wednesday 2/25</title>
  
  <p>
    Let's review the chain rule with a few examples, and then see how it can teach us rules for new functions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Find the derivatives of the following functions.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) = (\sin(x) + 3^x)^5</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) = (\sin(x)3^x)^5</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) = \left(\frac{\sin(x)}{3^x}\right)^5</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) = \cos(x^2 + 7^{\sqrt[3]{x}})</m>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is another interesting example: <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}</m>.  We have done this already using the quotient rule (to find the derivative of <m>\sec(x)</m>), but notice we could also write this as <m>f(x) = (\cos(x))^{-1}</m> and then it is a chain rule problem!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now for something new.  Use the chain rule to find the derivative of <m>e^{\ln(x)}</m>.  Yeah, I know.  We don't the derivative of <m>\ln(x)</m>.  So just leave that as <m>[\ln(x)]'</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    But wait!  <m>e^{\ln(x)} = x</m> (why?).  So this derivative will be the same as <m>(x)' = 1</m>.  So now solve for <m>[\ln(x)]'</m>
  </p>

  <p>
    We can conclude that if <m>f(x) = \ln(x)</m> then <m>f'(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>.

  <title>Friday 2/27</title>
  <p>
    Today in class we will finish section 2.6 to learn the derivative rules for <m>\arctan(x)</m> and <m>\arcsin(x)</m>.
