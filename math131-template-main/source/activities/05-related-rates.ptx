  <title>Related Rates Practice</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Solve the following related rates questions.
      For each, you should:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Draw a couple pictures illustrating the situation, labeling quantities that will be changing in the scenario.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Write down an equation that relates the changing quantities.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Take the derivative (with respect to <m>t</m>) of both sides of the equation to find an equation that relates the <em>rates of change</em> of the quantities.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Substitute known values into the equation to discover the unknown values.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

  <exercise workspace="5in">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A sailboat is sitting at rest near its dock.
        A rope attached to the bow of the boat is drawn in over a pulley that stands on a post on the end of the dock that is 5 feet higher than the bow.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the rope is being pulled in at a rate of 2 feet per second, how fast is the boat approaching the dock when the length of rope from bow to pulley is 13 feet?
      </p>

  <exercise workspace="5in">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A swimming pool is <m>60</m> feet long and <m>25</m> feet wide.
        Its depth varies uniformly from <m>3</m> feet at the shallow end to <m>15</m> feet at the deep end,
        as shown in the <xref ref="F-3-5-Ez3">Figure</xref>.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="F-3-5-Ez3">
        <caption>The swimming pool.</caption>
        <image width="40%" source="images/3_5_Ez3"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Suppose the pool has been emptied and is now being filled with water at a rate of <m>800</m> cubic feet per minute.
        At what rate is the depth of water
        (measured at the deepest point of the pool)
        increasing when it is <m>5</m> feet deep at that end?
        Over time, describe how the depth of the water will increase:
        at an increasing rate, at a decreasing rate, or at a constant rate.
        Explain.
