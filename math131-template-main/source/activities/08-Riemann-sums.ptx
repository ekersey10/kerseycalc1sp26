            Change in position is tied to the net signed area bounded by the velocity function.

        <answer>
          <p>
            The change in position is approximately <m>-1.44</m> feet.

        </answer>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Since the net signed area bounded by <m>v</m> on <m>[1,5]</m> represents the total change in position of the object on the interval <m>[1,5]</m>,
            it follows that <m>M_5</m> estimates the total change in position.

          <p>
            To estimate the total distance traveled by the object on <m>[1,5]</m>,
            we have to calculate the total area between the curve and the <m>t</m>-axis.

              D \approx \frac{7}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} + \frac{17}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 1 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + \frac{17}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} +  \frac{7}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{292}{125} \approx 2.336
