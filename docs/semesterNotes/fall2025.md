# Notes about Fall 2025

The materials mostly worked well this semester.  A few suggested changes for next time:

- Having learning target quizzes every week seems appropriate for Calculus I, although it would also be reasonable to group these into frequent longer exams.  The advantage of exams is that it might prompt students to put more effort into preparing for them, rather than just showing up and hoping the quiz goes well.
- We did not enforce deadlines for retaking learning target quizzes.  Next time, I would be much more strict with this: students must retake a learning target within two weeks, or else wait until the Final Exam (for instance).  If a student retakes within 1-2 weeks, then it might be reasonable to get a third attempt shortly after that.
- We saw a lot of students get A's in the class, likely including students who had a B or C level of understanding.  It would be a good idea to require some level of "extra" mastery (maybe called "Expertice" or "Mastery Plus") on a subset of the learning targets.  They could get this higher level by either mastering the target on the first try or by mastering two versions of it (within the 2-week retake window and then again on the Final).
