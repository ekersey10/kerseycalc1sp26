    Let's see how useful the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus can be.  The theorem tells us the relationships between the two main ideas in Calculus: derivatives and integrals.  But one way to <em>use</em> the theorem is to evaluate definite integrals exactly by finding antiderivatives.

    Remember what this looks like with an example.  Introduce the notation <q><term>evaluated between</term></q>:
    <md>
      \left.\int_2^6 x^3 \, dx = \frac{x^4}{4}\right|_2^6 = \frac{6^4}{4} - \frac{2^4}{4} = 324 - 4 = 320
    </md>.

    To use this, we need to find antiderivatives.  Create a chart of standard antiderivatives.  These are just our standard basic derivative rules written in reverse order.  Basically.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) = x^n</m> has antiderivative <m>F(x) = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}</m>.  This works for all <m>n \ne -1</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}</m> has antiderivative <m>F(x) = \ln(|x|)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f(x) = e^x</m> has antiderivative <m>F(x) = e^x</m>.  What about other bases for exponential?  <m>f(x) = 3^x</m> has antiderivative <m>F(x) = \frac{3^x}{\ln(3)}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Trig functions:  <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m> has antiderivative <m>F(x) = -\cos(x)</m>.  For <m>f(x) = \cos(x)</m>, an antiderivative is <m>F(x) = \sin(x)</m>.  What about other trig functions?  Note that we don't want to worry about this, but we can think about what derivatives we get to find new anti-derivative rules.  For example, what is the antiderivative of <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    Now use these to evaluate integrals.
