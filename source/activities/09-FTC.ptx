  <introduction>
    <p>
      You have just bought a new space heater to warm up your dorm room.
      It has a two-stage heating mechanism that includes heating elements and a fan to blow the air around.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>F(t)</m> be the temperature in your room (in degrees Fahrenheit) <m>t</m> hours after midnight on Tuesday, December 2nd.
      While you don't know much about <m>F(t)</m>, you have determined that the <em>rate of change</em> in temperature looks approximately like the graph shown below.
      Let <m>f(t)</m> be the rate at which temperature is changing (in degrees Fahrenheit per hour) <m>t</m> hours after midnight on the same day.
