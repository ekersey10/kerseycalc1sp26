  <title>Related to Related Rates</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Each scenario below describes how changing quantities are related to each other.  Eventually, we will use derivatives to describe how the rates of change of these quantities are related.
    </p>
    <p>
        But for now, let's make sure that we understand how to describe the relation between the quantities.  In each case, draw a picture, label quantities that are changing with variables, and write down one or more equations relating these changing quantities.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A rock is thrown into a still pond and causes a circular ripple.
        When the radius of the ripple is 15 inches, it is increasing at a rate of 3 inches per second.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        How much does the circumference of the ripple increase over the next second?
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
        <p>
            
            There are two quantities that change: circumference and radius.
            These are related by,
            <me>
                C = 2\pi r.
            </me>
            At the time in question, <m>r = 15</m>, so <m>C = 94.25</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            After one second, the radius has increased to 18 inches, giving a circumference of 113.1 inches.
            So the circumference changed by <m>18.85</m> inches.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A street light is at the top of a 16 ft tall pole.
        A woman 6 ft tall walks away from the pole with a speed of 4 ft/sec along a straight path.
      </p>
      <p>
        As she walks, the tip of her shadow moves along the ground.
        When she is 20 feet away from the pole, is she or the top of her shadow moving faster?  By approximately how much?
      </p>

          A picture for this problem

            \begin{tikzpicture}
            \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (0,.8) node[left]{\footnotesize 16} -- (0,1.6);
            \draw[thick] (2,0) -- (2,.3) node[left]{\footnotesize 6} -- (2,.6);
            \draw (0,0) -- (1,0) node[below]{\footnotesize $x$} -- (2,0) -- (2.6,0) node[below]{\footnotesize $y$} -- (3.4,0);
            \draw[dashed, thin] (0,1.6) -- (3.2, 0);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        </latex-image>
      </image>

      <p>
        Note the similar triangles.
        the smaller triangle's base <m>y</m> is the length of the woman's shadow.
        The larger triangle's base <m>x+y</m> is the distance from the light pole to the end of the woman's shadow.
        The heights of the triangles are 6 and 16, and since the triangles are similar, we get
        <me>
          \frac{16}{6}= \frac{x+y}{y}.
        </me>
        We are interested in what happens when <m>x = 20</m>.
        Solving for <m>y</m> we get <m>y = 12</m>.
        To find the exact rate of change in <m>y</m> we would need to do calculus.
        Instead, let's just compute <m>y</m> after one second, when <m>x = 24</m>.
        This gives <m>y = 14.4</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the total distance traveled by the top of the shadow is <m>6.4</m> feet (since the distance from the pole is <m>x+y</m>), so the top of the shadow is traveling at 2.4 feet per second more than the woman (approximately).

    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that two boats leave a dock at different times.
        One heads due north, the other due east.
        When the first boat is 33 miles from the dock it is traveling at a speed of 37 mph.
        At the same time, the second boat is 65 miles from the dock and is traveling at a speed of 26 mph.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the boats maintain their same speed and heading for another hour, by how much will the distance between them change?
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        Let <m>a</m> be the distance from the dock for the first boat, and <m>b</m> the distance for the second boat.
        Let <m>d</m> be the distance between the boats.
        All these quantities are changing, so we need an equation relating the quantities:
        <me>
          a^{2} + b^{2} = d^{2}.
        </me>
        At the time in question, we have <m>a = 33</m>, <m>b = 65</m>, so <m>d \approx 72.9</m>.
        After one hour, <m>a</m> has increased to <m>70</m>, <m>b</m> has increased to <m>91</m>, giving a new value for <m>d</m> of approximately 114.8.
        This is change of <m>41.9</m> miles.

  <exercise workspace="1in">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A potter forms a piece of clay into a right circular cylinder.
        As she rolls it, the height <m>h</m> of the cylinder increases and the radius <m>r</m> decreases.
        Assume that no clay is lost in the process.
        When the radius is 3 cm and the height is 6 cm, the height is increasing by 0.6 cm/sec.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If this rate continues, what will the dimensions of the cylinder be 2 seconds later?
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        We have two quantities that are changing: <m>h</m> and <m>r</m>.
        These are related to each other by the constant volume of the cylinder:
        <me>
          V = \pi r^{2} h
        </me>
        At the time of interest, <m>r = 3</m> and <m>h = 6</m>, so <m>V = 54\pi</m>.
        After two seconds, we will have increased <m>h</m> by <m>1.2</m>cm, to a new height of <m>7.2</m>cm.
        We can use our equation to find <m>r</m> at this time:
        <me>
          54\pi = \pi r^{2} 7.2
        </me>
        <me>
          r \approx 2.74
        </me>
      </p>
    </solution>

  <exercise workspace="1in">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of <m>40{\text{ft}}^{3}/\text{min}</m>.
        It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular cone whose base diameter and height are always the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which will take longer: to increase the height of the pile from 10 ft to 11 ft, or from 11 ft to 12 ft?
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        The base <em>radius</em> <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m> are changing, as well as the volume <m>V</m>.
        The relationships between these quantities are
        <me>
          V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^{2} h
        </me>
        <me>
          h = 2r.
        </me>
        We can combine these to get an equation relating just volume and height:
        <me>
          V = \frac{1}{3}\pi \frac{h^{2}}{4}h
        </me>
        <me>
          V = \frac{\pi}{12}h^{3}
        </me>
        Now consider what happens to the volume as height changes:
      </p>

      <tabular>
        <col halign="center" right="minor"> </col> <col halign="center" right="minor"> </col> <col halign="center" right="minor"> </col> <col halign="center"> </col>
        <row>
          <cell> <m>h</m> </cell>
          <cell>10</cell>
          <cell>11</cell>
          <cell>12</cell>
        </row>

        <row>
          <cell> </cell>
        </row>

        <row>
          <cell> <m>V</m> </cell>
          <cell>261.8</cell>
          <cell>348.5</cell>
          <cell>452.4</cell>
        </row>
      </tabular>

      <p>
        So the volume increases first by 86.7 cubic feet, and then by 103.9 cubic feet.
        Given that the volume is increasing at a constant rate with respect to time, it will take longer to make the second increase.
      </p>
