      <p>
        You decide to keep track of snowfall during a major snowstorm in Estes Park.
        The graph below shows the function <m>s(t)</m> that gives the amount of snow on the ground in inches.
      </p>

        <shortdescription>
          graph showing snowfall with respect to time with a tangent line marked at (3,5.2) with designates slope 3/4.

          <p>
            The x-axis is labeled <q>Time (in hours since yous tarted recording)</q>.
            The y-axis is labeled <q>Snow (in inches)</q>.
            The graph starts on the y-axis, slightly above the origin, then snakes upward with slight curves back and forth.
            The point The tangent line is drawn as a dashed line, intersecting the solid curve at the point (3, 5.2).
            The tangent line is labeled with its slope of 3/4.
            The curve ends at the tangent line.

        <p>
          Approximately how much snow do you expect to be on the ground 4.5 hours after you started recording?

        <p>
          You continue tracking snowfall, but don't check as often over time.
          Below is your table recording amount of snow at each hour.
          Using the table,
          Approximate <m>s'(21)</m>.
          What does this value tell you about the snow?
