  "body": " Syllabus     Welcome to what promises to be an exciting and fun semester of Calculus I! I know you are all eager to get started, but please take a few moments to familiarize yourself with this syllabus.     Course Information  This is the syllabus for Calculus I (MATH 131, section 005) for Spring 2026. It is a 4 credit course.

Additional times by appointment.   Important : I want to see you in student hours, and will happily make appointments with you outside of the regular hours. I'm also available by email and will respond within 24 hours, except on the weekends.    Class meets  M\/W\/F 9:05-9:55am and Tu 9:30-10:20am in Ross 2275.    Course Description  First course in a three course sequence in calculus. Differentiation and related concepts, applications of derivatives, including exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions.    Prerequisite  Appropriate ALEKS placement score ; or MATH 127 or MATH 125 with a minimum grade of C.    Textbook and course materials   Active Calculus, 2nd ed by Matthew Boelkins. This and all other course materials will be available for free through Canvas.      Course Overview  Calculus is about change.  A fundamental way to understand the world is by measuring amounts or quantities of things. How tall is that tree? How far above the ground is the space ship? How many gallons of water are in the tub? But rarely are these quantities static. How can we describe the way the quantities change, and how are the quantities and their change related? Can we predict how tall the tree will be next year? If we know how fast the spaceship is falling, can we predict when it will crash to the ground? When will the tub overflow?  To answer these and many more questions, we will explore one of the two fundamental tools in calculus: the derivative . To understand the derivative, we will need to understand the idea of a limit as well. We will become experts at computing derivatives of pretty much any function that has one. We will see how to use the derivative to solve mathematical and real world problems.  The derivative lets us move from quantity to rate of change. We will conclude the course by reversing this process, introducing the second fundamental tool in calculus: the integral .     Assessments and Grades  The goal of this course is to understand fundamental concepts of calculus. Measuring understanding is a difficult task. How can you (and I, since I'm assigning you a grade) be confident that you understand?  I don't have a perfect answer, but what we will use in this course is a combination of two types of indirect evidence.   You can accomplish a variety of tasks that someone with a good understanding of calculus should be able to accomplish. We will divide these tasks into 20 learning targets , listed below, and throughout the course you will have opportunities to demonstrate your mastery of these learning targets.    You engage meaningfully in mathematical practice, doing the mathematics that leads to understanding. This includes participating in discussions, exploring new ideas, trying hard things (often unsuccessfully at first), revising your work, and asking good questions. Your engagement will be measured through a combination of in-class participation on various types of homework assignments.   Regardless of your level of understanding entering this course, my hope is that you will leave with an improved understanding of mathematics. One of my favorite things about mathematics is that no matter how much you understand, there are still more fascinating connections to discover.   Learning targets  By the end of this course, you should be able to:   Find and interpret average velocity and its units, using information about the position function (as a table, graph, or function formula).    Estimate the derivative of a function at a given value using numerical or graphical data.    Use the limit definition of the derivative to find a formula for the derivative function.    Given the graph of a function, sketch an accurate graph of its derivative (including the correct sign, direction, relative heights, zeros, and any places where the derivative doesn't exist).    Interpret the instantaneous rate of change of a function and explain its meaning in context.    Recognize and explain the relationships among the behaviors of , , and by analyzing graphical or numerical information from one or more of , , and .    Find an equation of the tangent line to a function at a point and use the tangent line to approximate values of the function.    Find the derivative of polynomials, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions with fluency.    Use the product and quotient rules to find the derivative of a function.    Use the chain rule to find the derivative of a composite function.    Use multiple derivative rules in combination to find the derivative of a function.    Use implicit differentiation to find for a function defined implicitly, using basic derivative and structure rules in the process.    Solve related rates problems and interpret the results in the given context.    Solve applied optimization problems using appropriate derivative tests and write a concluding sentence that justifies my work.    Use derivatives to describe the behavior of functions, including local extrema, inflections points, intervals of increase and decrease, and concavity.    Use derivatives to evaluate limits with indeterminate forms by applying L'Hôpital's Rule.    For an object with a piecewise linear velocity function, compute the exact distance traveled and change in position of the object over a given time interval.    Compute a Riemann sum and interpret the result as an accumulation of a changing quantity.    Interpret a definite integral in terms of net-signed area.    Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate definite integrals exactly.       Assessment of Learning Targets  You will have multiple opportunities to demonstrate your mastery of the learning targets. Your first opportunity will be during weekly learning target quizzes , usually given in class on Tuesdays. Each quiz will be clearly aligned with one or more of the learning targets.  Quizzes will be graded and assigned a grade of U , P , or M , indicating you have demonstrated Unfamiliarity , Partial Understanding , or Mastery of the learning target.  For any learning target for which you do not demonstrate Mastery on your first attempt, you may reattempt to do so by taking another learning target quiz within two weeks of the original quiz. Additional attempts, and attempts beyond the two week window, will be granted only after meeting with me to discuss your progress and understanding of the learning target.  Occasionally, a grade of M- may be assigned if the quiz contains minor mistakes that could easily be corrected. In such cases, you may be able to elevate your grade to M without taking an additional quiz by revising your quiz appropriately (usually through discussion with me).  Your grade in the course will be partially determined by the number of learning targets for which you have demonstrated Mastery. There is no credit given for learning targets below Mastery level, and the number of attempts it takes to reach Mastery does not matter.    Final Exam  The final exam for this class is on Monday, May 4 from 8:00am to 10:30am . Instead of a traditional final exam, we will use this time as an opportunity for you to complete any learning targets you have not yet mastered.  In the unlikely event that the University is closed due to inclement weather on the day of our exam, we will hold the exam at the same time on Friday, May 8 (the designated makeup day for this situation). In the event that this makeup day is also canceled, I will contact you with alternative options.    Assessment of Mathematical Engagement  Your level of effort and engagement will be assessed through your participation in class and completion of a variety of homework assignments.   Participation  I expect you to attend every class and participate actively when present. This includes asking questions, contributing to discussions, and collaborating with your peers. You will get a weekly participation score based on your engagement.    Daily Prep Assignments  So we can make the most of our time in class together, you will be asked to prepare for each class by reading parts of the textbook and\/or completing online prep assignments.    Practice Problems  Each section of the textbook will be accompanied with a set of online practice problems. These are graded automatically and you have an unlimited number of attempts to get the correct answers.    Written Homework  Roughly every other week, you will be assigned a written homework question that will require you to demonstrate your understanding of the material in a more open-ended format. These will be graded and may be revised one time after they are returned. You will submit these by scanning your written work and uploading it to Canvas.       Final Grades  Your final grade will be calculated using the following table:      A  B  C  D    Mastery-level Learning Targets  18  16  14  12    Engagement Score  90%  80%  70%  60%    To receive a particular grade, you must meet or exceed the requirements for that grade in both categories . If you do not meet the requirements for a D, your final grade will be an F.  It is also possible to receive a plus or minus grade if your engagement score is one category above or below the level specified for the number of learning targets mastered. For example, if you have mastered 16 learning targets and have over 90% for your engagement score, your final grade would be a B+. If your engagement score is more than one level below your mastery score, the two levels will be averaged.    Note about Grades in Canvas  All your grades for all assignments will be kept inside Canvas, so you can always check to see how you are doing in this class.  However, note that your final grade depends on two measures: your mastery of the learning targets and your engagement score. The Total you see in Canvas is the total for the engagement score only. There is also a Learning Mastery tab where you can see which learning targets you have mastered.     Course Policies   Attendance  You are expected to attend every class period. It is impossible to receive participation points if you are not in class.  But what happens if you absolutely cannot attend class? Maybe you are very ill, somebody has slashed your tires, and you are having a bad hair day! These things happen, and I will try to be understanding when you communicate with me about your situation. Please reach out to me as soon as possible to discuss your options.  One important note though: in this class, just like in every other class, missing a day of class, even with a perfectly valid excuse, does not excuse you from learning what was covered that day. As your instructor, I will try to help you catch up, but this will take more work than it would have if you were in class.    Late work  Late work will be accepted only under extenuating circumstances and must be discussed with me in advance. Deadlines are set to encourage you to stay on track with the course material and manage your time effectively. If you are struggling to meet a deadline, please reach out to me as soon as possible to discuss your options.    Classroom Decorum  Turn off your cell phones when in class and keep them put away, arrive on time, and do not pack up your things before the end of class. All of these are potential distractions to yourself and your classmates that could negatively impact your learning.  Additionally, we expect that you will treat all members of our course community with respect and kindness. In doing mathematics, or almost anything worth doing in life, you are going to make many errors and false starts while becoming more proficient. Think, for example, of learning to play a musical instrument, or learning an athletic skill, or developing a friendship. We want to establish a classroom atmosphere where the inevitable struggles and mistakes become an opportunity to learn and grow; not an opportunity for embarrassment. Thus, please be constructive and polite in questioning your colleagues in class.    Academic Integrity  Don't cheat! It is expected that members of this class will observe strict policies of academic honesty in every aspect of this course. In particular, you are expected to solve homework problems by yourself or together with your group, and not find solutions online. In general, UNC's policies and recommendations for academic misconduct will be followed. For additional information, please see the Student Code of Conduct at the Dean of Student's website http:\/\/www.unco.edu\/dos\/Conduct\/codeofconduct.html .    Generative AI  The use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or CoPilot) is allowed in this course, but it is your responsibility to ensure that you use these tools with academic integrity.  What does this mean? Ask yourself what you hope to get out of this course. I really hope your answer involves learning new skills, becoming a better thinker, and understanding mathematics at a deeper level (even if these goals are in service to eventually getting a better paying and more fulfilling job).  AI tools can help you achieve these goals. Here are a few example prompts that you might find useful and are completely inline with these goals.    I am trying to learn the concept . Give me a sample question and ask me to find the answer and explain how I found it to you. Then ask me some followup questions, acting like a student I am tutoring on the topic. Make sure I can explain everything sufficiently so you can understand the concepts involved.      My professor gave me this sample quiz question: . Generate 5 additional questions that are similar in style and difficulty and ask me to give you the answers. Don't give me solutions until I have done so, but point out any errors I might have made.      Here is an example from my textbook: . Make up a similar question and walk me through a solution step my step, asking me to ask questions after each step to make sure I really understand the process.       Warning: As good as AI has become recently, it is primarily a linguistic model rather than a mathematical one, so anything you get out of a generative AI tool should be approached with a fair amount of skepticism. This is also a good way to learn mathematics though: play find the mistake in what AI gives you!  To be clear, you should NOT use AI tools to shortcut the learning process. Getting someone else to do your work for you (even if that someone is a robot) is plagiarism and a violation of the academic integrity policy.    Title IX and Equal Opportunity  The University of Northern Colorado is committed to providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students that is free from discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. Students who have experienced (or who know someone who has experienced) any of these concerns should know that they are not alone. UNC has staff members in the University's Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) who are trained to support students in navigating these concerns and are able to provide on- and off-campus resources and supports, referrals to health and counseling services, academic and housing modifications, and mutual no-contact orders between individuals.  Please be aware all UNC instructors and most staff members are required to report their awareness of sexual misconduct to the OIEC. This means that if students tell an instructor about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the instructor must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator and Equity Officer, Jimmy Kohles. Mr. Kohles or a trained staff member in OIEC will contact the reporting students to let them know about resources and support services at UNC as well as their options to pursue an investigation through OIEC, law enforcement, or both. Students who have experienced these types of incidents are not required to speak with OIEC staff regarding the incident. Students' participation in OIEC processes are entirely voluntary.  If students do not want the Title IX Coordinator notified, instead of disclosing this information to the instructor, students can speak confidentially with the following people on campus and in the community. They can connect you with support services and help explore options now, or in the future. UNC has confidential victim advocates available 24\/7 by phone - students can contact the Assault Survivors Advocacy Program (ASAP) at 970-351-1490 to seek confidential guidance and support.     Suggestions for Success  First and foremost: I want you to succeed . I am here to help you learn and grow as a mathematician. I also know that this isn't always easy. Here are a few things to keep in mind when you are feeling stuck or overwhelmed.   Ask questions  Perhaps the single most important skill you can learn is how to ask questions. Think of question-asking not so much as a way to get answers, but as a way to clarify your thinking.    Ask for help  Don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it. Whether it's from me, your classmates, or other resources, there are many opportunities for support. I have regular student hours and am happy to schedule additional time as well.  You can also take advantage of the Math Study Center in Ross 1250 for drop-in tutoring and the UNC Tutoring Center in Michener L149 which provides free peer-led tutoring services by appointment.    Embrace the struggle  Learning mathematics can be challenging, but that is exactly what makes it so valuable. You wouldn't go to the gym and lift 1lb weights every day and expect massive gains (as the kids say). Instead, you need to push yourself, take on more challenging problems, and be willing to struggle a bit in order to grow.    Help each other learn  Collaboration is key to success in mathematics. Work together with your classmates, share your insights, and learn from one another. Teaching a concept to someone else is often the best way to solidify your own understanding.     I also want to acknowledge that there are often external factors that can impact your opportunity to learn. Below are some resources offered through UNC that may be helpful.   Disability Resources  My goal is to co-create a learning space that is inclusive and responsive to your access needs. If you anticipate or experience barriers to full participation in this course for any reason, please connect with me. Whether it's related to course design, content delivery, or materials, I welcome that dialogue.  If you are connected with the Disability Resource Center (DRC), please share your accommodation letter early so we can plan together.  If you are not yet connected but would like to explore accommodations or access resources, you can contact the Disability Resource Center: 970-351-2289, drc@unco.edu , Michener L-80, www.unco.edu\/disability-resource-center .    Food Insecurity, Housing Insecurity, and Other Essential Needs  Significant numbers of UNC students are challenged in getting enough food to eat. Others have difficulty finding safe and stable housing or meeting other essential needs, such as medical and mental healthcare, childcare, and transportation. Still others face financial crises in the wake of unexpected emergencies.  Through its Center for Student Well-Being (CSW, located on the lower floor of the UC), UNC offers personalized 1-on-1 assistance to students facing food insecurity, housing insecurity, financial emergencies or other basic needs challenges. UNC also provides students with access to several food resource programs on campus, including the Bear Pantry , where students can access food and hygiene items at no cost. Resource navigators in the CSW can also help students gain access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other resources.    Student Well-being  If you're not sure where to turn, the website for UNC's Student Outreach and Case Management office lists a wide variety of resources for students. Case Managers can assist students during difficult circumstances which may include medical, mental health, personal or family crisis, and illness or injury.  Mental health professionals are available on-campus and in the community. See a wide variety of on- and off-campus resources on the Dean of Student's webpage .  For free, confidential consultations, check out the Counseling Center . To access staff in the Counseling Center, call 970-351-2496 or stop by the Center, located on the second floor of Cassidy Hall.  If you or someone else is experiencing a crisis or suicidal thoughts and the Counseling Center is not available (including evenings, weekends, and holidays), contact either North Range Behavioral Health by calling 844-493-TALK (8255) or text TALK to 38255 or the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.

  "body": " Week 1 (1\/12 - 1\/16)  This week focuses on an introduction to what Calculus is about, and the first two sections of Active Calculus.   Monday, 1\/12  Welcome to Calculus! Wait, what is Calculus? Today we will explore this in part by doing . We start with that and then discuss as a group. Some notes:   There are two quantities that we are measuring: distance traveled and speed. Clearly, there is some relationship between these, but what is it? That's what calculus is all about.    Note that from physics, and really the definition, we have that . That makes sense if we are looking at a constant speed, or in our case, an average speed .    Next time, we will explore how these concepts relate to each other in more depth.       Tuesday, 1\/13  Today we will explore the relationship between distance, average velocity, and instantaneous velocity. This is covered in the textbook in section 1.1.   The activity from Monday gave us some ideas that distance and velocity are related, but sometimes in a unclear way. Let's try to understand this in a more precise mathematical way.    We can describe the two quantities as functions . In particular, both distance and speed are functions of time . (This is a good choice that we are making, but it is a choice.)    When we have a function, we can represent it in different ways, such as with a table of values, a graph, or an equation. No idea what the equation is, but we might be able to draw a graph of each.    We can think about how the graphs are related. What does a high speed mean for the distance graph?    Here is another important question: how can we estimate one value from the other? That is, if you know the speed function, can you estimate the distance traveled? That's essentially what you do in the activity, question 2.    What if we wanted to go the other way? If we know the distance function, can we estimate the speed? Actually, how does the car determine the speed? How does a radar gun work??    Note that from physics, and really the definition, we have that . That makes perfect sense for a constant speed, or an average velocity . But what about the speed right now ? In this very instant, how fast is the car going?     Let's give a careful definition of average velocity and explore what happens when you look at the average velocity over different time intervals.   We define average velocity as: where is the distance function in terms of time .    Compute an example. Suppose the height of a drone (in feet) is a function of time (in minutes) given by the equation: for the interval . Compute some average velocities. Use Desmos for this. You can create a slider automatically to explore different values.    What about the graph here relates to velocity? Which points on the graph have large velocity? Which have velocity zero? Does this make sense?    Look at the formula for average velocity. What does the numerator represent on the graph? What does the denominator? What graphical quantity is described by their ratio?    Aha! The average velocity is nothing but the slope of a line through two points on the graph of the distance function.    Explore what happens to that line as the two points get closer together. If the instantaneous velocity is the average velocity when the two points are infinitesimally close , can we determine the velocity at a given point?    Graphically, this is the slope of the tangent line at a point on the graph of the distance function.    Can we also do this symbolically? See what you get for the function when you let that slope be in terms of the distance between the points.    What does it mean to be infinitely close ? We will explore this next time and in section 1.2.     We will use the model of distance and velocity for a lot of our investigations in this course. But importantly, the tools we develop can be applied to many different functions.   Another car example: your gas mileage is a function of your speed. As your speed changes, we can ask what happens to your mileage.    The price of eggs is a function of time. We can measure the rate at which the price changes over time too (called inflation). You might hear that inflation is dropping. Does that mean that prices will go down? Well, if you slow down, does that mean you get closer to the airport?    The area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter is a function of its length. As the length changes, we can ask what happens to the area.       Wednesday, 1\/14  Today we will introduce the idea of a limit, which is essential for understanding the relationship between average velocity and instantaneous velocity .   Remember that the average velocity is given by . This does not say how fast you were going at any particular time, but does give your average speed over the interval from to .    What if the interval is very small? Then you might be going faster or slower at certain points on the interval, but it would be reasonable to assume that your average speed is close to your speed at a specific point in time. After all, how much could your speed change in a millisecond?    Okay, maybe it does change a lot, even in a millisecond. So just zoom in more. Make the interval even smaller.    As you make the interval smaller and smaller, look at what happens to the average velocity. Does that average velocity get closer to some value? If so, we say that limit value is the instantaneous velocity .     The concept of a limit makes sense for all sorts of functions, not just the average velocity.   Let . What happens as approaches 2? We will write this as . We want to evaluate this limit.    Use Desmos to explore this. Plug in values closer and closer to 2 on both sides . Does the value of the function (the output ) seem to approach a particular number?    Of course, is just . So we can say that . But this doesn't always work.    Try and evaluate . We cannot just take since this does not exist. But maybe the limit does?    An important point: Look at the definition of the limit. We want to find some value that we can get as close as we want to, just by making the input close enough to (the input we are approaching).    Consider the function . What happens if we try to evaluate this function at ? Here we want to simplify this fraction (try factoring the numerator).    But don't we just care about average velocity? Well, the function above is an average velocity function. What is the average velocity between and for the function ?       Friday, 1\/16   Let's practice working with limits.    Let .     Find .     Find .     Find .      Find .      Find .         Evaluate the limit: .      Evaluate the limit:       For each of the two problems above, for what distance function does the limit represent an instantaneous velocity?      "

Tuesday, 1\/20  Today we will start by discussing any questions about the practice problems due tonight. Then some discussion section 1.3 on the derivative at a point. Finally, we will do the first Learning Target Quiz.     Look at question 2 from last Friday's activity. We want to evaluate that limit. Notice that it is a very particular type of limit. It is a limit of an average velocity between two points. What are they?    The points are and , where .    Look at the preview activity for 1.3. Go over this carefully.    We will want to evaluate these sorts of limits a bunch. But what does look like for different functions? Try this out with a bunch of different examples.    The limit of this difference quotient is called the derivative of at , and written . Here we are thinking of as a specific number. So examples would be or .       Wednesday, 1\/21  Learning target quizzes discussion. Reminder: you try this again so that you can demonstrate mastery. Your next opportunity is next Tuesday. Let's talk a little bit about instantaneous velocity.  Let's continue investigating the derivative of a function at a point .   Look at the interactive applet the textbook links to. Compare this to the definition of the derivative we discussed in class and the idea of the instantaneous velocity.    We can always approximate a derivative at a point by approximating the limit of the average rate of change. In other words, approximating the difference quotient at that point.    Sometimes, we can find the derivative exactly by computing that limit exactly.    Let's think of this as two distinct steps: First, we want to find an expression whose limit is the derivative at a point. Second, we want to evaluate that limit.    Here are some examples. For each function below, write a limit that represents the derivative at the given point.        Let . Find an expression for , the derivative at . Then repeat for .    Let . Find an expression for , the derivative at .    Let . Find an expression for , the derivative at .    Let . Find an expression for , the derivative at .     Pay attention to how the substitution of the function and the difference quotient interact.  Now, evaluate some of the limits we found. Note that the last one... no clue what to do there.    Friday, 1\/23  Today we start looking at section 1.4, thinking about the derivative as a function.   Start with an example. Let . Find . Then, what is ? Can we also find ?    In fact, we can find for any number . One way to think of this is that we are creating a rule to help us find a lot of different derivatives. We are giving a recipe. No matter what is, we can always find by simply...    But really we are doing more. At any point in the domain of , we can find a derivative. That derivative changes when changes. So there is actually a function of derivatives.    We can describe a function in multiple ways. A formula. A table. A graph.    Look at a graph of a function. At any input, we can ask: what is the slope of the line tangent to the graph? We can then collect these answers in a table. That is describing the derivative function! We can also graph these values to get a graph of     Let's repeat this with a few functions.   a piecewise linear function.    A parabola.                        "

Thinking about the derivative as a function of slopes or of instantaneous rates of change. So instead of finding , we are finding a function .  Here are two things to try:   Sketch the graph of and guess its derivative .           Let . Find using the limit definition.    Interesting, we get the equation of a line for the derivative. This line is NOT the tangent line: it is a line that gives slopes of tangent lines at any given point.    Let's try the same thing with .    Graphically, what do we guess the derivative function will look like?    Using the limit definition, find . We will need to multiply out .       Tuesday 1\/27  Now we know how to approximate and compute derivatives (even if we don't yet have shortcut rules). But what is the derivative good for? Why do we care? Sure, instantaneous velocity is great, but is it good for anything else?  There are lots of other speeds we can consider.   Let be the temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) in a room at time (in hours). Then is the instantaneous rate of change of temperature with respect to time, measured in degrees per hour.

The units of the derivative are always . One notation for the derivative is . Another notation is , which is read as the derivative of with respect to . This notation emphasizes the units of the derivative.  The derivative does not always have to be with respect to time. The preview activity for today asked about the function , which gave the time (in hours) it takes to drive 50 miles at miles per hour. What are the units of ? What are the units of ?

Your car's fuel efficiency depends on the speed you drive. Let be the fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon) when you are driving at speed (in miles per hour). What are the units of ?     Okay, one more: your speed is also a function of time. What happens when you accelerate? Your speed increases! We can ask for the rate at which your speed (which is already a rate of change) changes. We are taking the derivative of a derivative. We call this the second derivative and write .  Explore this idea by completing the activity    Friday 1\/30  Today we finish section 1.6 which explores the second derivative. Start by reviewing the second half of the activity. In particular, look at question 5 and fill in the blanks.  Let's look at another function, just graphically. In Desmos, graph the functions . Desmos can graph and automatically. What do we notice?  Make a chart with some possible shapes of graphs and what we can say about , , and .   Consider an increasing, concave up function . Since is increasing, is positive.

As we have discussed, functions might not have a derivative everywhere. Section 1.7 looks at various ways that limits might not exist, and since derivatives are limits, these might not exist either.  But actually, speaking of this, consider what happens when you zoom in at a point that is differentiable vs one that is not. Not being differentiable usually means that is a cusp at that point (although points with vertical tangent lines are also not differentiable).   Look at graphs on desmos. Maybe . No matter how far we zoom in, we still have a cusp.    But now look at . Zoom in at the point and you see that if you zoom in enough, the curve looks like a horizontal line.    In fact, also graph the tangent line, . Can you tell these apart when you zoom in? No!    A differentiable function and its tangent line share both a common point and a common derivative at that point.    Since it is often easier to evaluate the equation of a line at a point than a function at a point, we can approximate a function at a point by evaluating the tangent line there.    So two important, closely related ideas are:   Given a function and a point , we can consider a line that also passes through the point and has slope equal to .    Given a function and a point , we can consider a linearization function that satisfies and .       The only difference between these two is the context we are thinking about. The first is a set of points that satisfies an equation. The second is a linear function (whose graph is exactly that line).     Here is an example. What is ? Okay, we know that is 2. In other words, think of and we are asking for . What is ? We could evaluate a limit and find . Now find for . We get   So what is ? That's pretty easy to compute: . Since the local linearization is a good approximation for the function for values of close to , we have that . (In fact, ).     In section 1.5, we used this idea too. Suppose is the temperature hours after midnight. and . Can we approximate ?    Those statements tell us that at 3am, the temperature is 58 degrees, and is dropping at a rate of 2 degrees per hour. I don't know what is going to happen in the next hour (maybe the temperature will start increasing), but our best bet is that in the next 15 minutes (0.25 hours), it will decreasing 1\/2 a degree.    We can write down the local linearization function: . Evaluate this at : .       Tuesday 2\/3  Today we worked through Activity 1.8.3 from the textbook.

Then what's wrong with the following interpretations of the hippo functions?      means in 30 days, the hippo's weight has increased by 2 pounds per day.    Every day the hippo grows 2 lbs on average for the first 30 days.    The hippo gained weight at 2 lbs\/day when it is 30 days old.    After the 30 days, the increase in weight of the hippo is increasing at 2 lbs\/day.    30 days after the hippo's birth, the rate of weight gained per day is 2 lbs\/day    After every 30 days after birth, the hippo gains 2 lbs.    Every day the baby hippo's weight goes up 2 lbs.    The weight of the hippo increases by 2 lbs over the 30 days.    The hippo approximately gains 2 lbs after 30 days.    means that 100 stickers cost 5 cents per sticker.     represents that the price goes up 0.05 dollars after every 100 stickers.    For the 100 stickers, each one will cost 0.05 dollars.    After 100 stickers, each sticker would cost 5 cents.    The cost is increasing 5 cents every 100 stickers.

Today, let's practice these derivatives. Write down a bunch of functions that we can take derivatives of and do it. Include some that need to be simplified first.  What if we have ? Is the derivative ? No! We can verify this by graphing both. So actually we do want to graph these exponential functions and numerically compute the derivatives. It turns out that for any constant , the function has derivative .  In other words, the derivative if an exponential function is proportional to itself, with constant of proportionality where is the base. Note that since , this says that .    Tuesday 2\/10  The goal of section 2.2 is to develop rules for the derivatives of and . We could think of these rules as arbitrary, but to help us remember and make sense of them, it will be useful to briefly review some trigonometry.  Perhaps you learned trigonometry as a method for finding the lengths of legs of right triangles. What does and tell you there?  We want to extend this meaning to a larger domain of angles, not just between 0 and 90 degrees.  Now we want the triangle with base on the -axis and angle at the origin to still obey the usual relationships for and . So this means that will be the -value of the circle, and is the -value.  Now continuing this, it makes sense to ask for . We just need to know what the value is on the circle at that point.  Notice that we are using a circle with radius 1 here, so while , we really get .    Wednesday 2\/11  Let's pick up where we left off with our review of basic trigonometry.     First we want to switch to using radians. What do those means? 1 radian is the angle that gives you an arc of the circle of length equal to the radius of the circle.    The key thing though is that the circumference of a circle is , so the full angle of a circle gives an arc length of times the radius. Thus a full circle ( ) is radians.    From this, we can divide a circle into smaller chunks. Half a circle is radians, etc.     Now we can think of both and as being functions of . But here is the angle and is the value of the function (which is an or value on the unit circle). Let's graph those functions.  Now what about the rate of change of those functions? Think about what increasing from 0 to 1 radian does to the and values on the unit circle!  We can also look at this graphically, by considering slopes of the sine and cosine functions.  The point is, and   Now let's see how to combine all the rules we have so far. Work through the activity.    Friday 2\/13  We used today as an opportunity to catch up on learning target quizzes.

Monday 2\/16  We know how to take derivatives of a bunch of basic functions, as well as how to take derivatives of functions that are the sum or difference of those functions. The sum rule says that the derivative of a sum is just the sum of the derivatives. That is, if is the sum of two functions, we can find by taking the derivatives of each of the two functions and adding the results.  However, this is not true for products. On the one hand, we can quickly see that this fails if we take the derivative of . On one hand, we could simplify this function as , so . However, if we took the derivative of the two parts separately, we would have and . Multiplying those would give which is definitely not the same.  Another reason to be skeptical: suppose a magic rectangle has sides and , both of which are increasing with time. The area of the rectangle is then also a function of time. That is, .   Let's say that and . Then . How much new area do you get if increases by and increases by in the next day? Does the area just increase by ?    No, since growing to 23 doesn't just add 3 feet: we get area of more feet! And when the width increases by 4 feet, that adds more feet.    Draw the picture. Every increase in one dimension must be multiplied by the current size of the other dimension.    In other words, the increase is .     This gives us the product rule : if , then .  Do a few examples with functions we know. Start with .  Quotients have a similar rule: the quotient rule says that if then . We can prove this from the product rule by noting that . Apply the product rule and then solve for .  Try some examples.  Note that we can use both rules in the same function. A function that is the ratio of a product and another function, for example.    Tuesday 2\/17  Today we practiced additional examples of the product rule and the quotient rule, including an example where the product rule is required in the numerator of a quotient.    Wednesday 2\/18  Our goal today is to discover derivative rules for the rest of the main trigonometric functions: , , , and .  First, remember the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity : . This is just a version of the Pythagorean Theorem on the unit circle. We will use this to simplify the derivatives for the other trig functions.  Look at . In right triangles, is the ratio of the leg opposite the angle to the leg adjacent to it. But look at the unit circle, and remember that and , we have . So to find the derivative of we should apply the quotient rule to that ratio.  Similarly, we can do this for all the other functions. Go through them.    Friday 2\/20  Today we will do a little review about what we know how to do with derivatives already and explore the one way we don't yet know to take derivatives of combined functions.  Start with four warmup derivatives.  In the very few minutes left after that, we discussed what composition of functions looks like. This will help us understand the chain rule next week.   "

Monday 2\/23  Today we learned the chain rule and went through many examples. See section 2.5 of the textbook for such exampels.    Tuesday 2\/24  Let's think a bit about why the chain rule makes sense. Remember that the chain rule describes how to take the derivative of a composition of functions: . For this to make sense, it must be that the output of is a reasonable input to . What functions would this make sense for?   Suppose you own a company that makes artisanal soap. The number of bars of soap you can make is a function of the amount of money you spend on supplies, say . The amount of money you earn from your soap business is a function of the number of bars of soap you make (and sell): . What happens to your income if you increase your investment by a dollar when you are already spending $100?    Another application: the daily water consumption in Greeley is a function of the population: . The population of Greeley is a function of time: . At what rate is the water consumption increasing as a function of time?     We can also use the limit definition of the derivative to understand the chain rule.   Anyway, let's do some more examples. First a straight forward example, such as . Then a few where you need to use the chain rule together with other rules, like the product rule, the quotient rule, or the chain rule itself.    Wednesday 2\/25  Let's review the chain rule with a few examples, and then see how it can teach us rules for new functions.  Find the derivatives of the following functions.                        Here is another interesting example: . We have done this already using the quotient rule (to find the derivative of ), but notice we could also write this as and then it is a chain rule problem!  Now for something new. Use the chain rule to find the derivative of . Yeah, I know. We don't the derivative of . So just leave that as .  But wait! (why?). So this derivative will be the same as .

The bottom of the ladder is being pulled away from the wall at a constant rate. What can we say about how fast the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall?   Let be the distance from the wall to the bottom of the ladder, and let be the height of the ladder on the wall.    We know that .    How much does the top of the ladder move when the bottom of the ladder moves 1 foot (from 0 feet to 1 foot)? What if the ladder moved a foot from 5 feet to 6 feet?    What we want to know is what is for any value of . Now if we had a function for in terms of , we would just take the derivative of that function.    Certainly depends on , but we don't have an explicit function for in terms of . We have an implicit relationship between and .    Luckily, we can still compute by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to . When we get to the term involving , we will need to use the chain rule, since is a function of (so it is an inside function ).    Do this.     There are lots of interesting implicitly defined functions. For example, the equation defines implicitly as a function of . (This is called a folium of Descartes .) Graph this using Desmos. Then use implicit differentiation to find .  Play around with different implicit equations in Desmos. Find one and verify where the tangent really is vertical using implicit differentiation.    Tuesday 3\/3  Today we continue exploring implicit functions and their derivatives.  Using desmos, graph a few of the following:                           A very useful way to understand these problems is to find their local maxima. This will be a spot where the tangent line is horizontal, or where .  To find we evaluate the derivative of both sides, with respect to (i.e., take of both sides). Any term with a will require the chain rule, since is a function of .  Let's do this for one of the examples, say .    . This becomes .    Now we solve for :     The maximum value here will be where this derivative is 0. The only way for the fraction to be zero is if its numerator is 0. So we want to find such that .    First, find . Now substitute this in to the original implicit function: Now we can combine like terms and divide both sides by (although note what happens at , this is also a place where the tangent line is horizontal.)

  "body": " Week 9 (3\/9-3\/13)   This week we will begin looking at applications of the derivative, starting with Related Rates, discussed in Section 3.1.    Tuesday 3\/10  Calculus gives us tools to understand how quantities change. We have seen this appear primarily when we are given a function that describes the values of a quantity in terms of some independent variable. But there are also interesting examples of multiple quantities that change in tandem, both functions of some common variable. These related quantities with have related rates of change .  Let's start with a classic example: a ladder is sliding down a wall. Previously, we assumed that the bottom of the ladder was moving away from the wall at a constant rate, and described the top of the ladder's speed in terms of the distance from the wall to the base of the ladder.   Now let's assume that we don't know about the speed of the bottom of the ladder. We just want to describe the relationship between the speed of the top of the ladder and the speed of the bottom of the ladder, both in inches per minute (so in terms of time , not height in terms of distance).    The relationship between the distance from the wall to the base of the ladder , and the height of the top of the ladder , can be described using the Pythagorean Theorem.    We have , where is the length of the ladder. Both and are functions of time , . The length of the ladder is presumably constant, let's say 10 ft.    Just like we did with implicit differentiation, we will take the derivative of both sides of this relationship, but this time with respect to (instead of with respect to ).    We get .    We can now answer lots of questions, provided we know two or three of these four quantities\/rates. For example, how fast is the top of the ladder moving if when the base of the ladder is 6 feet from the wall, it is moving at a rate of 3 feet per second? Note that we can determine the value of from knowing , using the original (static) relationship (we get ). Since we also know , we can substitute three values and get the fourth.     Return to the handout from last class with the other related rates scenarios. Try using implicit differentiation to find the relationship between their rates. Do as many as there is time for (start from the last question, since we didn't ever write down the original static relationship).    Wednesday 3\/11  Today in class we will practice with related rates questions by completing the activity.    Friday 3\/13  Today we will finish the related rates activity from last time and then start exploring section 3.2 on L'Hôpital's Rule.  Our next application of derivatives takes us back to evaluating limits. Suppose we want to evaluate the limit . Note that if we try to plug in , we get . This is called an indeterminate form .   Try graphing this function on Desmos to make a guess at the limit value.    Now just for fun, let's take the derivative, not of the entire function, but of the numerator and denominator separately.    What is ? Now we can just plug in and get . That is exactly what the original limit it appeared to be.    Why does this work?     Remember that a differentiable function can be approximated by its tangent line, at least very close to the point at which it is tangent. This suggests that if we replace both the numerator and denominator with their tangent lines, the ratios will be the same.   What is the equation of the tangent line for the numerator and denominator in this example?    Notice that the terms cancel.    This means we are only left with the slopes. That means that the ratio of the functions is well-approximated by the ratio of their slopes.    This doesn't just happen for this example though. What do we get for arbitrary ? Write down the general tangent line approximation for each. Notice that the and will both be zero, which is exactly why this only works when you start with an indeterminate form.      "

Find .     Another use case for L'Hôpital's rule is to find end behavior of functions. That is, what happens to a function as gets arbitrarily large. We write this as . Here are some examples.

Tuesday 3\/24  Today we went over some more examples of L'Hopital's rule, mostly from the practice, including situations in which it is better to do some algebraic simplification first.    Wednesday 3\/25  We will start exploring the big application of derivatives: maximizing and minimizing a function. This starts with section 3.3, and will continue with 3.5 and 3.6 (we will skip 3.4).  Today we start by looking for local extrema. What we explore today will not really feel like an application, but hopefully it is not too much of a leap to think that the functions we have here could describe some real-world quantity (say cost or revenue) that we would like to minimize or maximize.  Start by looking at a graph that has local maxima, minimal, cusp points, and a saddle point. Consider what each of these are in terms of local extrema, global extrema, and values of the derivative.  What can we learn from this example? What is the connection between the local extrema a critical numbers : inputs at which the function has either derivative zero or no derivative?   If a function as a local max\/min at input , then either or does not exist. We call such a critical number , the point a critical point and the output a critical value     However, just because is a critical number, doesn't mean that has a local extrema at .    Why not? What can stop this from happening? This is where we use the first derivative near  to understand the behavior of the function.    The first derivative test says that if is a critical number of a continuous function that is differentiable near (except possibly at ), then we can look at the sign of on either side of to determine whether has a local maximum or minimum at . In particular, if changes from positive to negative at , then has a local maximum at . If changes from negative to positive at , then has a local minimum at .    We could also\/alternatively use the second derivative test : if is a critical number of a continuous function such that and , then has local maximum at if and only if and has a local minimum at if and only if .     Now lets see how this all works with an example. Consider . Find the critical numbers (factor), classify each using both tests, find points of inflection. Graph the function (by hand). Check that this makes sense by graphing with desmos.  Another example (needs quadratic formula) .    Friday 3\/27  Let's practice using the first and second derivative tests to explore the behavior of some functions, including finding local maxima and minima, intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing, inflection points, and any asymptotes.  Start with an easier one: .  Next, try a slightly more complicated example: . Note we need to use the quotient rule here, and then factor the numerator to simplify it.  Another similar one: .   "

  "body": " Week 11 (3\/30-4\/3)   Monday 3\/30  In section 3.3 we discovered that to find local (or relative ) extreme values of a function (maximums and minimums), we must look for inputs at which the derivative was zero or undefined (these inputs are called critical numbers ). This is a powerful tool that will be useful in applications.  However, we often are more interested in determining the global maximum or global minimum : the optimal value over all.  Do the first activity (3.5.2) from active calculus.  Must all functions have a global maximum or minimum? Well, a very simple function, does not. Any number you think is the maximum of the function will quickly be exceeded, just by increasing the input (and similarly for minimums, of course).  In practice though, we usually have some sort of constraint on the domain of the function. It might not make sense to allow inputs to be less than 0, for example. Or there might be a maximum allowable input. If we consider functions on closed intervals , then it turns out these always do attain their global maximum and minimum values (as long as the function is continuous on that interval).  Draw some pictures to illustrate this.  What does this mean in practical terms? The global maximum and minimum for a continuous function on a closed interval must occur at either a critical number or at one of the end points of the interval. So we really only have a handful of options. Which input gives us the largest\/smallest output? Just try them all!  Find the global maximum and minimum of on the interval .    Tuesday 3\/31  How can we use global optimization to solve real world problems? Here is an example.  A piece of cardboard that is (each measured in inches) is being made into a box without a top. To do so, squares are cut from each corner of the box and the remaining sides are folded up. If the box needs to be at least 1 inch deep and no more than 3 inches deep, what is the maximum possible volume of the box? what is the minimum volume? Justify your answers using calculus.    Wednesday 4\/1  Today we will explore ways to solve applied optimization problems. The examples can be found in the activity.    Friday 4\/3  We will do more practice with applied optimization today, using the same activity from Wednesday.  We focused on question 2 from the worksheet. We will not get through all of these, but on Monday at least some of the time will be spent answering questions from the practice set.   "

  "body": " Week 12 (4\/6-4\/10)   Monday 4\/6  Today, we might start section 4.1, but more likely we will work some applied optimization problems from section 3.6. Questions from the practice problems would be good, or we can pick a problem from the samples distributed last week.  To start section 4.1:   At the very beginning of the course, we motivated all of calculus with an example about driving back from DIA. We realized there was a connection between the distance traveled, the time that took, and the velocity of your car.    In particular, we noted that velocity was given by distance divided by time. Or more precisely, , the change in distance divided by the change in time.    This allowed us to find the average velocity over any time interval. As that time interval got smaller, we said that these average velocities were essentially the instantaneous velocity. This led us to the definition of a derivative, which we have been studying for the last two months.    Another question we asked that first day though: if you recorded your speeds every 5 minutes, can you estimate how far you have traveled? We said after 5 minutes, you noticed speeds of 75mph, 60mph, 65mph and 50mph. Or in terms of miles\/minute, these numbers are 1.25, 1, 1.08, and 0.84.      Tuesday 4\/7  Today we will start exploring the connection between velocity and distance  Continuing our exploration of moving from velocity to distance:   Example: suppose you drop a ball down a well. Since acceleration on earth is a constant feet per second squared, the velocity after seconds (assuming that the initial velocity was 0). We are thinking of positive velocity as moving downward here, otherwise we would make the 32 negative. Can we find the distance traveled by the ball? Graph this, look at the antiderivative, and look at area,.    Another question we asked that first day: if you recorded your speeds every 5 minutes, can you estimate how far you have traveled? We said after 5 minutes, you noticed speeds of 75mph, 60mph, 65mph and 50mph. Or in terms of miles\/minute, these numbers are 1.25, 1, 1.08, and 0.84.    In fact, for any rate of change of some quantity, the total change in that quantity will be the rate of change multiplied by the change in independent variable. Thinking about units here is helpful.    A very useful observation about derivatives or instantaneous rates of change, is that these can be pictured graphically as slopes. What is the graphical interpretation of going the other way?    Consider a graph of a constant function that represents a velocity. What does the product of velocity and time look like? It is exactly the area under the graph . That's because the velocity is the height of the function, and the time is the width of the interval on the horizontal axis.    But what if the function is not constant? Well, we can still think of distance as being an area under the curve: just think of the curve as infinitely many small horizontal line segments, sort of like a staircase that when you zoom out looks like a smooth curve.    A big idea: we also have developed a symbolic way to represent rates of change: the derivative function. For example, if the distance traveled is given by the function then the velocity is . Okay, well now if I told you the velocity was , what is the function that describes the distance? We can take an antiderivative .       Wednesday 4\/8  The plan for today is to do a much deeper dive into section 4.1 by working through an activity that highlights the connection between antiderivatives and area. We will also consider what happens when the function is negative and how this should impact these calculations.  We will work through Activity 4.1.3 from the textbook.    Friday 4\/10  We will start on section 4.2 today by considering a systematic way to approximate area under a curve using what is called a Riemann sum .  First, a reminder of what we are doing here. We noticed that if we are given a velocity function, we can find the change in distance by multiplying the velocity by the change it time. Okay, this only works for constant velocity. To resolve this, we will just approximate the velocity function by a sequence of constant velocities that are close to the true velocity.  It is also very helpful to picture this product of velocity by change it time as the area under the velocity curve. In fact, everything we are doing can be thought of as simply a geometry problem of finding area under a curve.  So how do we approximate this area (i.e., this change in distance)? We divide up our interval into a bunch of sub-intervals and find the area (change in distance) for each sub-interval. Then add them up.  Some notation:   We use summation notation or Sigma notation using the Greek letter to represent a sum. For example, . Try a few more examples.    This will be useful because what we really want to do is add up a bunch of areas. So we will want to find .    Now what is each ? Each is a base times a height. Let's first think about finding the bases.    We have some intervale that we want to find the area under (draw the picture). Suppose we divide this up into sub-intervals. We will call each sub-interval . What is its value? Well, .    What about the heights (velocities) for each rectangle? How tall are they? This is given to us by the function. We just need to decide what input to use to find that height.    As an example, consider the function on the interval . Let's first divide this interval into sub-intervals. Keep track of where each sub-interval starts and stops. Call the endpoints of the sub-intervals . What inputs should we use to find the heights?    We can choose to use the left endpoint of each sub-interval. Doing so will give us a left Riemann sum , which we would call . If we choose the right endpoints, we get a right Riemann sum , denoted . We could also pick the midpoint of the sub-interval, giving a middle Riemann sum , . The subscript is , so we can also ask for , , .    For this example, note that the following table of values is useful:     0 .5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4    16 15.75 15 13.75 12 9.75 7 3.75 0        "

We then introduced the concept of a definite integral as a limit of Riemann sums. We will explore this more next time.    Wednesday 4\/15  We have seen that Riemann sums can be used to approximate the net signed area between a curve and the horizontal axis, and that this area can also be interpreted as the net change in position if the original curve represents velocity.  To get better approximations, we increase the number of sub-intervals. When we consider the limit of these approximations as tends to infinity (i.e., as the width of each sub-interval tends to 0), we get the exact net signed area between the curve and the horizontal axis. We give this an name: the definite integral .  Write this down and label all the parts (like we did last class).  Just like the derivative from chapter 1, we have a definition that involves a limit. We also have a few interpretations of what this means, that make it a lot easier to reason about definite integrals.   The definite integral gives the net signed areas bounded by the function and the horizontal axis on the interval .    If the integrand is a velocity function, then gives the net change in position, .    While we could evaluate limits of sums to find (or evaluate ) definite integrals, this is not easy. Instead we can compute area using geometry or use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which we will explore next time.    Go through the examples in Activity 4.3.2 for the geometric approach.    For part (d), note that we are making some assumptions about how we can break up the integral instead of evaluating it all at once.     Some properties of integrals that are useful:         . This makes sense if you think of , but it is true even if the numbers are not in order.     . That is, if you travel backwards along the interval, the integral is the negative of travling forwards. This is because the you get will be the negative of the original.     . This is the constant multiple rule, just like we had for derivatives. Does this make sense? Look at Desmos to see what happens when you multiply a function by a constant.     . The sum rule. Again, look at desmos to see that this makes sense.     One more cool thing we can do with integrals: find the average value of a function.   Think about what the average value of a set of numbers is. But what if we wanted to find the average value of a function. That has an infinite number of points.    So really what we want to compute is .    Now compare this limit to the limit of a right Riemann sum. They are sort of similar, since .    In fact, we get .    Think back to what the integral tells us about change in position when integrating velocity. The other way we can think about finding change in position is by multiplying the time spent going that velocity by the velocity. But what if velocity isn't constant? Well, multiply time by average velocity .       Friday, 4\/17  Today we will start section 4.4 to discover the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. But first, from section 4.3:  One more cool thing we can do with integrals: find the average value of a function.   Think about what the average value of a set of numbers is.

Baked into the formula for average value of a function is the (hopefully familiar, at this point) idea that gives the total change in position between and , where is the velocity corresponding to position function .   In other words: . But think about the relationship between and . Velocity is the derivative of position. So another way we could write the equation above is .    In fact, for any continuous function, we can think of that function as a velocity function for some position function it is the derivative of. Big idea: if we can get our hands on that position function, we can use to compute the integral (instead of using a limit of Riemann sums).    Notation: given a (continuous) function , let be antiderivative of (that is, ).    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) is that .    More notation: instead of writing we will write .    Let's use the FTC to evaluate some definite integrals. Do some examples involving constant functions, linear functions, polynomials, basic trig and exponential functions.      "

The theorem tells us the relationships between the two main ideas in Calculus: derivatives and integrals. But one way to use the theorem is to evaluate definite integrals exactly by finding antiderivatives.  Remember what this looks like with an example. Introduce the notation evaluated between : .  To use this, we need to find antiderivatives. Create a chart of standard antiderivatives. These are just our standard basic derivative rules written in reverse order. Basically.    has antiderivative . This works for all .     has antiderivative .     has antiderivative . What about other bases for exponential? has antiderivative .    Trig functions: has antiderivative . For , an antiderivative is . What about other trig functions?

  "title": "Related to Related Rates",
  "body": " Related to Related Rates   Each scenario below describes how changing quantities are related to each other. Eventually, we will use derivatives to describe how the rates of change of these quantities are related.  But for now, let's make sure that we understand how to describe the relation between the quantities. In each case, draw a picture, label quantities that are changing with variables, and write down one or more equations relating these changing quantities.      A rock is thrown into a still pond and causes a circular ripple. When the radius of the ripple is 15 inches, it is increasing at a rate of 3 inches per second.  How much does the circumference of the ripple increase over the next second?    There are two quantities that change: circumference and radius. These are related by, At the time in question, , so .  After one second, the radius has increased to 18 inches, giving a circumference of 113.1 inches. So the circumference changed by inches.      A street light is at the top of a 16 ft tall pole. A woman 6 ft tall walks away from the pole with a speed of 4 ft\/sec along a straight path.  As she walks, the tip of her shadow moves along the ground. When she is 20 feet away from the pole, is she or the top of her shadow moving faster? By approximately how much?     A picture for this problem    Note the similar triangles. the smaller triangle's base is the length of the woman's shadow. The larger triangle's base is the distance from the light pole to the end of the woman's shadow. The heights of the triangles are 6 and 16, and since the triangles are similar, we get We are interested in what happens when . Solving for we get . To find the exact rate of change in we would need to do calculus. Instead, let's just compute after one second, when . This gives .  However, the total distance traveled by the top of the shadow is feet (since the distance from the pole is ), so the top of the shadow is traveling at 2.4 feet per second more than the woman (approximately).        Suppose that two boats leave a dock at different times. One heads due north, the other due east. When the first boat is 33 miles from the dock it is traveling at a speed of 37 mph. At the same time, the second boat is 65 miles from the dock and is traveling at a speed of 26 mph.  If the boats maintain their same speed and heading for another hour, by how much will the distance between them change?    Let be the distance from the dock for the first boat, and the distance for the second boat. Let be the distance between the boats. All these quantities are changing, so we need an equation relating the quantities: At the time in question, we have , , so . After one hour, has increased to , has increased to , giving a new value for of approximately 114.8. This is change of miles.      A potter forms a piece of clay into a right circular cylinder. As she rolls it, the height of the cylinder increases and the radius decreases. Assume that no clay is lost in the process. When the radius is 3 cm and the height is 6 cm, the height is increasing by 0.6 cm\/sec.  If this rate continues, what will the dimensions of the cylinder be 2 seconds later?    We have two quantities that are changing: and . These are related to each other by the constant volume of the cylinder: At the time of interest, and , so . After two seconds, we will have increased by cm, to a new height of cm. We can use our equation to find at this time:        Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of . It forms a pile in the shape of a right circular cone whose base diameter and height are always the same.  Which will take longer: to increase the height of the pile from 10 ft to 11 ft, or from 11 ft to 12 ft?    The base radius  and height are changing, as well as the volume . The relationships between these quantities are  We can combine these to get an equation relating just volume and height:  Now consider what happens to the volume as height changes:               10  11  12           261.8  348.5  452.4    So the volume increases first by 86.7 cubic feet, and then by 103.9 cubic feet. Given that the volume is increasing at a constant rate with respect to time, it will take longer to make the second increase.     "

The heights of the triangles are 6 and 16, and since the triangles are similar, we get We are interested in what happens when . Solving for we get . To find the exact rate of change in we would need to do calculus. Instead, let's just compute after one second, when . This gives .  However, the total distance traveled by the top of the shadow is feet (since the distance from the pole is ), so the top of the shadow is traveling at 2.4 feet per second more than the woman (approximately).

At the same time, the second boat is 65 miles from the dock and is traveling at a speed of 26 mph.  If the boats maintain their same speed and heading for another hour, by how much will the distance between them change?    Let be the distance from the dock for the first boat, and the distance for the second boat. Let be the distance between the boats. All these quantities are changing, so we need an equation relating the quantities: At the time in question, we have , , so .

This can either be a scan of handwritten solutions or a PDF you created by first typing your solutions.  Note that the last prompt asks you to write a project proposal . This should be written out in paragraph form. Pretend you are really trying to earn the business of the farmer, so make it professional and accurate.      A local farmer has reached out to your family's livestock containment company for an estimate to create a habitat for their new emus. The requirements given to you by the farmer are:   Create a rectangular habitat that is 4000 square feet total, divided into two equal sized areas.    Exterior fence must be 6' tall sturdy 12 gauge galvanized steel.    Interior fence to divide the two areas can be 4' tall and as needs to only be 16 gauge.    Since emu's like to run, it is preferable to have one dimension of the individual areas be at least 100' long.   The farmer has requested a project plan, including estimates, for the habitat. Your dad has asked you to use calculus to help write the proposal.  On your end, you know that including parts and labor, the exterior fence will cost $15 per foot, while the interior fence costs only $10 per foot.     Start by drawing a schematic for the project.      Suppose one dimension is exactly 100'. Find the other dimension and compute the exact cost for this version of the habitat.      Is there a way to reduce the cost for the farmer? Create a function that gives the total cost of a project when the long side of the habitat is feet long. Verify that is the same cost as you found in the previous part.   You will likely want to first write in terms of two dimensions. Then use the fact that the total area of the habitat must be 4000 square feet to eliminate one variable.       Sketch a graph of the function on an appropriate domain.      Use calculus to find the absolute minimum of the function , both with and without the restriction that one side of the habitat must be 100' long.      Use what you have found in the above parts to write a self contained project proposal, that includes at least two options for the farmer. Clearly explain what the options are, how much they would cost, and what the farmer would get with each. Remember, you are trying to sell fence here. Don't dissapoint your dad!      "
